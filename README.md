# 🧥 Dress Changing App - Virtual Try-On using OpenCV

This project is a simple proof-of-concept virtual try-on application developed using Python and OpenCV. It allows you to change the outfit of a person in an image by overlaying a different dress image, simulating a "dress changing" or try-on effect.

## ✨ Features

- Overlay a new outfit onto a base image  
- Image alignment and masking with OpenCV  
- Simple, beginner-friendly code structure  
- Interactive visualization using Jupyter Notebook  

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📁 How It Works

1. Load a person’s image and a clothing image.  
2. Process and align the dress with the target region on the person.  
3. Blend the dress onto the original image using masking techniques.  

## 🧪 Use Cases

- Virtual fashion try-on  
- Augmented reality applications  
- Fun image manipulation demos
